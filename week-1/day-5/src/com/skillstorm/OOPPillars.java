		/*
		 * ENCAPSULATION
		 * - wrapping state and behavior up into classes
		 * - access control
		 * 
		 * INHERITANCE
		 * - parent/child or superclass/class/subclass relationships
		 * - reusability of existing state/behavior
		 * - group objects together by common parent, etc.
		 * 
		 * POLYMORPHISM
		 * - "many forms"
		 * - overriding/overloading to modify methods based on parent/child relationships or parameters
		 * - covariance
		 * 
		 * ABSTRACTION
		 * - hide the details and only reveal the parts that are necessary for the "user"
		 * - abstract classes and interfaces
